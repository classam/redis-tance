## Imaginary Documentation

* sync objects using streams
*  each object has a separate stream
*  only makes sense for large objects
    like "all of my friends"
* modify an object with an x => x function
* create a little table (Tance.Table)
    with a schema and indexes
* create a list sorted by date (Tance.LastTen)

- a user has sessions
- each session comes with a subscription to an object like
    "all of my friends" and "notifications for me"
- the status of that object is synced between the
    server, the connected client, and the API client
- a world has instances
- each instance comes with a subscription to an object like
    "all of the users in this instance"
    and "the memory of this instance"
